# drive_sync
Short little blep to sync local folders to Google Drive

This program syncs listed pathnames in 'sync_folder_registry.txt' to matching Google folder IDs.

### Run program:
Run 'upload.py'

This [Medium](https://medium.com/@s.laszloffy/<insert_article_name_here>) post runs through my process, and how to implement this code yourself!

Project based off of Sam Stands' project, which you can read about [here](https://medium.com/swlh/sync-a-folder-on-your-computer-to-google-drive-with-python-5155e73e18ca)
